        My name is Kenneth Chan and I am 17. I go to King George Highschool and my main educantional background for this class is taking Computer Science 1 where we only worked 
      with Java. My parents who grew up in China have a Highschool diploma equivalent of education. The first person in my family to graduate college was my 
      brother. He graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelors in Biology and then a PhD in 2018.

        I am learning to program because it is something that I find interesting and fun. In addition to me enjoying programming, I am also taking this course so that I can 
      experience what a college level course in this subject is like and make sure that it is truely a field I want to study. At the moment my career goals are not clear nor 
      definite but I do know that whatever happens I want to end up in a career that I will enjoy. The career in question does not have to pay incredibly well. I would be 
      satisfied if it provided me with enough money to live comfortably and not have to worry about any major financial issues. Currently my top two choices for colleges that 
      I want to go to are Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia. I will be applying to these two schools in this coming college application season. I want to apply to 
      these two colleges because they are both in Virginia so I would only have to pay In-State tuition and their programs in STEM and reasearch are very good.
