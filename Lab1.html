      My name is Kenneth Chan and I am 17. I go to King George Highschool and my main educantional background for this class is taking Computer Science 1 where we only worked 
      with Java. Both of my parents grew up in China and have a Highschool diploma equivalent of education. The first person in my family to graduate college though was my 
      brother. He graduated from Virginia Tech with a PhD in 2018..
